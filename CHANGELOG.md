# Nate VST Changelog

## 2026-06-26

### Rename To Nate VST

- Renamed the JUCE/CMake target from `Floorform` to `NateVST`.
- Changed the plugin product name shown to hosts from `Floorform` to `Nate VST`.
- Updated the VST3 bundle path to `Nate VST.vst3`.
- Moved new user presets to `~/Library/Application Support/Nate VST/Presets`.
- Changed user preset extension from `.floorformpreset` to `.natevstpreset`.
- Renamed the main processor/editor C++ classes to match the new product direction.

### Home Dashboard And Control Feel

- Added a `HOME` panel as the default first view.
- Reworked the first screen into a practical dashboard with engine, shape, lab, and library areas.
- Added quick access to waveform, filter mode, mono, tone-shaping knobs, recipe randomization, and preset load/save from the home panel.
- Reduced rotary knob drag distance and enabled velocity mode so knobs respond with less physical mouse travel.
- Added an automatable `filter_mode` parameter with low-pass, band-pass, and high-pass modes.
- Wired randomization to use filter modes where it adds useful variation, especially minimal blips and noise FX.

### Expanded Synth Source Mixer

- Added oscillator 2 with independent waveform, octave, tune, and level controls.
- Added oscillator 1, oscillator 2, sub, and noise source levels to the synth engine.
- Added a sine sub oscillator one octave below the played note.
- Added a white-noise source for stabs, blips, and noise FX recipes.
- Added source-level compensation so layered patches stay closer to a safe output range.
- Updated HOME and SYNTH panels with the new source mix controls.
- Updated randomization recipes so basses can use sub reinforcement, stabs can use detuned oscillator 2, and noise FX can lean into the noise source.

### Control Ergonomics Pass

- Reduced rotary drag distance again so knobs respond with less mouse travel.
- Added drag/hover value popups for rotary and horizontal sliders.
- Disabled snap-to-click behavior so controls do not jump unexpectedly.
- Added double-click reset for every slider using the parameter default value.
- Added clearer hover, pressed, and selected states for text buttons and segmented selectors.
- Added hover emphasis to rotary knob rings.
